# Beginner Track Setup

We recommend taking the easiest route available for getting a usable development environment
prior to the start of Midwest PHP's beginner track.

## Install MAMP

Your work environment, probably either a Windows or MacBook laptop, requires:

 - PHP (version 7.2 or newer)
 - Web server
 - Database
 - Code editor (IDE) such as Visual Studio or PhpStorm

The simplest route is to install MAMP (it's free) on your macOS or Windows computer. Links:

 - [MAMP for Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/)
 - [MAMP for Windows](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)

(Choose the windows or mac version of the documentation as appropriate.)
